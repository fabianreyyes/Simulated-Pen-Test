# Scoping

Scoping is the initial phase in the pen-testing process. Staying within your scope is imperative prior to commencing any active penetration testing activities. Within our current simulated environment, access is restricted solely to the Kali boxes on the left. Additionally, we possess the capability to toggle the machines within the target network on/off, optimizing resource utilization within the simulated ecosystem.

SCOPE: 192.168.122.47

## Understanding the environment

To the left, we have the attacker group's machines operating Kali Linux at 192.168.122.209.

On the right, the target network resides at 192.168.122.47. Within this network, App1, FS1, DHCP1, and DC1 function as servers, while SOC 1-7 and Dev1 serve as endpoints.

## Where does the scope come from?

In a penetration testing engagement, the scope is typically defined in collaboration between the client (the organization commissioning the test) and the penetration testing team. Once the scope is established and agreed upon by both parties, it serves as the foundation for planning and conducting the penetration test. It provides clarity on what will be tested, the methodology that will be employed, and the boundaries within which the testing will be conducted.

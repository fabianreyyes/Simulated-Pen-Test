# Scoping

Scoping is the initial phase in the pen-testing process. Precise delineation of your scope is imperative prior to commencing any active penetration testing activities. Within our current simulated environment, access is restricted solely to the Kali boxes on the left. Additionally, we possess the capability to toggle the machines within the target network on/off, optimizing resource utilization within the simulated ecosystem.

SCOPE: 192.168.122.47

## Where does the scope come from?

In a penetration testing engagement, the scope is typically defined in collaboration between the client (the organization commissioning the test) and the penetration testing team. Once the scope is established and agreed upon by both parties, it serves as the foundation for planning and conducting the penetration test. It provides clarity on what will be tested, the methodology that will be employed, and the boundaries within which the testing will be conducted.

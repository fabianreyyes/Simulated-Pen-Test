# Stage 3: Exploiting Vulnerability

### What Is A Reverse Shell

A reverse shell is a method attackers use to access a victim's system. The reverse shell is so effective because of the way most firewalls are already configured. Most firewalls default to deny all inbound traffic but allow all outbound traffic. A reverse shell is so effective because the attacker uses an exploit to send out a shell from the victim's system to the attacker's WAN to gain access. This bypasses the firewall because it allows all traffic outbound rules to send a shell to the attacker's WAN. 

### How To Catch A Reverse Shell
To catch a reverse shell you need 3 things: 

- Listener (think: _'thing that catches reverse shell'_)
- Port Forwarding rule (think: _'thing that forwards reverse shell from router to kali'_)
- Payload (think: _'thing that sends you a reverse shell'_)

### Listener

```bash
nc -lvp 44554
```

The command is used to listen for incoming connections on a specific port.

nc: stands for "netcat" which is a versatile networking tool used for various communication purposes.

-l: instructs netcat to listen for incoming connections on a specified port.

v: enables verbose mode, providing more detailed output about the connection.

p 44554: specifies the port number (44554 in this case) on which netcat should listen.

# Stage 2: Recon

The reconnaissance (recon) stage in penetration testing involves gathering information about the target system or network to identify potential entry points and vulnerabilities. This phase typically consists of passive and active techniques.

## Passive

Involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target system. Techniques include searching public sources such as social media, company websites, search engines, and public databases for information like employee names, email addresses, technology in use, and organizational structure.

--- **Everything beyond this point can be considered a felonly offense if you do not have consent from the victim you are targeting.** ---

## Active 

Entails direct interaction with the target system to collect more detailed information. This can include techniques such as network scanning to identify open ports, services, and operating systems, DNS enumeration to discover subdomains and associated IP addresses, and whois queries to obtain information about domain registration.
